            <h2>Definition and classification of intangible assets</h2>
            <p class='pd-bottom'>An <b>intangible asset</b> is an asset that lacks physical substance. Examples are patents, copyright, franchises, goodwill, trademarks, and trade names, reputation, R&D, know-how, as well as any form of digital asset such as software and data. This is in contrast to <em>physical assets</em> (machinery, buildings, etc.) and <em>financial assets</em> (government securities, etc.).</p>
